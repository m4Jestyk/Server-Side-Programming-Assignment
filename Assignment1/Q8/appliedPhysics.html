                    <h2>Applied Physics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Applied Physics is the concepts of basic physics 
                        and includes basics of physics and its a great topic for research purposes
                        It handles the concepts of YDSC interference etc.
                        The topic includes practicals using lasers ans split experiments are done here.
                        The concepts of light as a wave are proved here.
