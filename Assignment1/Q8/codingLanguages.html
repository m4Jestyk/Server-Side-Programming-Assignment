                    <h2>Coding Languages</h2>
                    <p>
                        The coding languages are also taught to control
                        the computer via programming.
                        This course consists of firstly teaching C language by which students understand how the coding languages interact with the system
                        also to understand memory allocation and deallocation in C language.
                        Then to make familiar students with the concepts of Object Oriented Programming They are taught C++ Language.
                        Their the main focus is on the Objects and classes and also on the encapsulation and abstraction concepts. 
                        Then since they have to work in a company as per requirements they are taught Java and Python to make them familiar with these languages.
